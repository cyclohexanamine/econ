A simplistic grid-based economy system. 
Each grid is modelled as a unit that moves its production towards that which produces the most wealth.
Prices are allocated to goods based on their supply, their local marginal utility, and the trade prices of their neighbours.
Production of goods is determined as a function of population allocated to a resource.
